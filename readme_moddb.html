<h2>Sleeping Ironman - Anomaly 1.5.1</h2>
<p>Modifies ironman mode to include time spent sleeping when determining when to grant a new life. Files included in the mod allows you to choose whether you want to count all of the time spent sleeping or only half of it, although customizing the factor to suit your needs is almost trivial.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>ZIP archive contains two folders:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Sleeping Ironman - Half Sleep</strong> which counts only half of the time spent sleeping, e.g. if you get a new life every 24 hours, staying awake for 12 hours and sleeping for additional 12 will count as 18 hours in game.
    </li>
</ul>

    <li>
        <strong>Sleeping Ironman - Full Sleep</strong> which counts all of the time spent sleeping, e.g. if you get a new life every 24 hours, staying awake for 12 hours and sleeping for additional 12 will grant you new life.
    </li>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>Would love to hear your feedback on the "feel" of the game. The Half Sleep variant still keeps the original feel and tension, but offers another chance after a rare slip up or just bad luck.</p>
