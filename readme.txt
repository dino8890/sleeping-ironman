Sleeping Ironman - Anomaly 1.5.1
Author: doom8890 @ moddb.com
================================

Modifies ironman mode to include time spent sleeping when determining when to grant a new life. Files included in the mod allows you to choose whether you want to count all of the time spent sleeping or only half of it, although customizing the factor to suit your needs is almost trivial.

Installation
